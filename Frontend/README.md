# The Frontend for Shopping Store App Shop24x7!

<p>This is the front-end Angular and Bootstrap portion of the Shop 24x7 App that I helped create alongside a couple of team-mates at an IT-consulting based bootcamp, the full website additionally uses a Node.js backend along with mongoose and mongoDB for middleware. This portion of the code is where I have contributed the most to.</p>

<p>The features that the website are as follows:</p>

1. User-friendliness - Directions are easy to follow, pages are organized by nav-tabs via bootstrap.
2. Organization - Shopping items are organized by department, website pages are routed through Angular components.
3. Admin Access - Adminstrative permissions on the full website allows users to modify items, and orders.
4. Order History - Website allows users to create a profile, and track previous orders through mongoDB.


This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.2.6.
